When developing AI-powered applications, you move beyond conversational prompting to more advanced strategies. In this course weâ€™ll explore advanced prompting techniques and strategies like Chain-of-Thought and Tree-of-Thought, clarifying how they work, what sets them apart, and what they are for.

## Instructions
This repository has a folder `/prompts/` containing prompt examples from the course you can copy-and-paste into your preferred AI tool including ChatGPT and Claude. Each example is named for the chapter, video number, and technique it represents. Some videos may have multiple examples.

There is also a single file `links.md` containing relevant links to academic papers and practical examples explaining the various techniques demonstrated in more detail. While not required reading, they are a good reference if you want a deeper understanding of how these techniques emerged and how they are tested.

# How to use the exercise files

- [Instructor] To make it easier for you to follow along and to give you the tools you need to experiment with these advanced prompt engineering techniques on your own time, I've created exercise files for this course. You can find them on GitHub. There are two important components to these exercise files. First off, there's a folder called Prompts, and here you'll find files for each of the movies. All the movies are in chapter one, and the files are named for the movie number, so two, three, four, et cetera. And each of these files contains a text example. These text examples are what you'll copy out and paste into ChatGPT or whatever other AI you're using, and you'll get the results. The reason why some of these movies have more than one example is because there are more than one example in that movie. The other file you need to be aware of is this one, links.md. This contains links to all the academic papers that back the different advanced prompt engineering techniques and demonstrating in this course. Some of these papers have really useful examples towards the end, so you can see how these techniques are applied in different ways. And in this list, there are also a couple of examples of GitHub repositories with more advanced buildouts of some of these techniques. As you go through the course, I encourage you to follow along with the examples in the Prompts folder. And when you're done watching the course, you can take any of these examples, modify them in any way you want, and use them as your own prompts in ChatGPT or in your other AI applications.
