Imagine three different experts are answering this question. 
All experts will write down 1 step of their thinking, then share it with the group. 
Then all experts will go on to the next step, etc. 
If any expert realises they're wrong at any point then they leave. 
The question is: 
48 people are riding a bus. On the first stop, 8 passengers get off, and 5 times as many people as the number who got off from the bus get into the bus. On the second stop 21, passengers get off and 3 times fewer passengers get on. How many passengers are riding the bus after the second stop?
